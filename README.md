# Zemoga Front End Development - Candidate Test v2.1 - By: Andrés González
In this repository you will find the entire project where I built an interactive secction for the client's app Rule of Thumb™️. Basically this app tracks the sentiment of their users on trending and controversial people from different fields, including politics, business, media and entertainment, etc. The website has the following requirement: they need to present their users with an easy way to share their opinion on each presented celebrity, using votes (thumbs up and down), and display the results to the user while the poll is open. These features should be available to all users, regardless of where they're accessing the website from, whether it's a smartphone, a tablet or a desktop computer.

The approach for this project was using HTML, CSS and JS vanilla. The idea of creating a web app with frameworks was always on my mind, however this time I was looking to challenge myself by putting in practice the very base of the web: HTML, CSS and JS.
